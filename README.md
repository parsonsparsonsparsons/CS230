--Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room, they wanted to design a new version of an already existing game, Draw it or Lose it, which was loosely based on the game Win Lose or Draw. Originally the game was only available on certain platforms, they wanted to expand access to other platforms.

--What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In general I documented most of the high level items that needed to be addressed when creating the specifications.

--What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The template was helpful as it provided a baseline document to fill in as each project was completed.

--If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably go into more depth in regards to certain details. As I stated above I tried to take a high level analysis approach to the design specifications. Drilling down deeper into more specific areas would definitely help the document and expand the reader's understanding/

--How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting the user's needs is an exercise in empathy and putting yourself in their shoes. If you don't understand what the product is actually supposed to do then you may end up creating something the user doesn't even want. This results in wasted time and resources. This is also where the agile methodology comes into play as you constantly refine requirements and realign to make sure that every task is moving towards that user's vision.

--How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Designing software is always something that can be improved upon and making mistakes is one of the best ways to get better at it, as long as you learn from it. No one is perfect. The techniques that I would recommend are to start with big picture understanding and work on essential proof of concepts to determine what is feasible and what isn't. Understanding the requirements is also crucial, as stated earlier you do not want to design a product that no one asked for. Communication, teamwork and feedback is essential.
